# Properties Demo

Demo of property binding in Codename One used within this blog post: https://www.codenameone.com/blog/properties-are-amazing.html

Properties allow seamless introspection and observability which means we can automate many tasks without the need for bytecode manipulation or other "problematic" tricks. In this case the properties are bound to the database and the GUI which is auto-generated.

I left an old hand coded implementation of the UI code for reference but it isn't really used, the entire edit UI is generated magically:
